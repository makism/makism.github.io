      <description>If I were to a favorite book, that would be Gibsonâ€™s &amp;ldquo;Neuromancer&amp;rdquo;; hackers jacking into the cyberspace by projecting their consciousness into a shared virtual space, a hidden layer augmenting the perceived reality. That was cyberpunk at its finest form; humans&amp;rsquo; brains interfacing with computers and enhanced cognitive capabilities. Now I am in position to realize the blur between science fiction and reality. Ideas and notions that were previously thought to be science fiction are becoming reality and that is something that overwhelms me.</description>
